We use the Image method from the Pillow module to process the images.
We convert each pixel to RGB values and concatanate each of them into one whole 
Red sum, Green sum, and Blue sum based of the RGB system.
We put these sums into a dictionary and convert the values into md5 hexadecimal values.
We add all these md5 hexadecimal hashes together and take the md5 hash of that whole big string.
Which finally yields the flag.
