The description of the challenge is written in binary.
After we convert it ASCII we simply get:
Binary Folders?
Extract the zip, notice some folders are missing.  Treat missing ones as 0, and present ones as 1.  Start at 0, end at 111.
Running the script gives you 0111101100110000010011100100010101011111010110100100010101010010001100000101111100110000010011100100010101111101
.
Decoding gives you flag:
{0NE_ZER0_0NE}
