Google once again....
Quoting wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate
"As of 2011, the [Guinness World Record] for fastest CPU is by AMD with a Bulldozer based FX chip "overclocked" to 8.805 GHz"
"As of mid-2013, the highest clock rate on a production processor is the IBM zEC12, clocked at 5.5 GHz, which was released in August of 2012."

But it asked for the official one, in other words the Guiness world record so the flag was:

Flag: 8.805 GHz
