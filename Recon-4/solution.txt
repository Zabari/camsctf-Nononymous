So from the wording of the problem, tumbling and blog I figured the next step is to search Tumblr.
Also, they said mediocre-guy, where as in proper english it would just be mediocre guy, so I knew something was off.
I searched tumblr for a user named mediocre-guy and sure enough I found one:
http://mediocre-guy.tumblr.com/

After unsuccessfully filtering his posts, I decided to search his tags for the flag which led me to this web page:
http://mediocre-guy.tumblr.com/tagged/flag

There should be a few images, and one transparent one, which when we open in a different tab reads:
{tr4n5p4r3ncy_ftw}
which is our flag.

Flag: {tr4n5p4r3ncy_ftw}
