So I tried a lot of things to no avial, eitherway I'll just cut to the chase.
1. In terminal I ran "strings excel_data.xlsx"
We get a bunch of weird stuff but we find something interesting:
"xl/charts/flag.txt"

2. Eventually, I extracted the contents of the spreadsheet and used cd on the path above ^^
3. in terminal run "cat flag.txt" and we get our flag.

Flag: {iT's_r1gh7_h3r3}
